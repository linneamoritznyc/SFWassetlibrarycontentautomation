## Phase 0: Repo and folders

**What works**

- pnpm workspaces over `apps/*`, `workers/*`, `packages/*`, `scripts/*`.
- Turborepo tasks: `dev`, `build`, `lint`, `typecheck`, `test`.
- ESLint 9 flat config, Prettier, Vitest, one shared `tsconfig.base.json`.
- Every folder in the spec's tree exists, each top-level one with a README
  saying what lives there.
- `.env.example` carries every variable from backend spec section 12.
- `CLAUDE.md` at the root and in `docs/`.
- Dockerfiles for the three workers, each with what that worker actually needs
  (FFmpeg and Python for media, Chromium for render, nothing extra for light).

**How to test**

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build        # builds every package, worker and the web app
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
```

All five must pass on the empty skeleton. Nothing here talks to Supabase, R2 or
Anthropic yet, so no keys are needed.

`pnpm format:check` also passes. Markdown is excluded from Prettier so the three
supplied source documents stay byte-for-byte as you wrote them.

Every screen in the spec exists as a route with a placeholder saying which phase
fills it: `/library`, `/inbox`, `/clips`, `/week`, `/scout`, `/learned`,
`/questions`, `/errors`, `/settings`, plus `GET /api/health`.
